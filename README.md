## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.w3schools.com 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
When first starting this project, I was unsure how well I could do in html/css/js as they are things I have less experience in than the rest of my repitoire.
I don't know all the necessary libraries to do everything on JS, so I was nervous. The hardest part was indeed the confusion of the 
Interval methods. Everything else was very well organized and easy to follow.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I were to have any questions about web development, it would be if there were any better ways to create a project? 
The look an appearance of a website is the hardest thing for me and can take me hours to make perfect, but I know those with experience can show proficiency in
this field.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I were able to work more on this project, I would make a fun mode where you can play tunes from popular 
songs instead of just randomized notes.
